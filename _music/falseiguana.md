Anthony Burr:
"We made these recordings in the summer of 2017. Ted played his modular system which melds custom built analog and digital processes. I played an old Univox combo organ. I've always loved the idea behind organ drawbars: it blurs perfectly the whole issue of timbre and pitch. When you pull a drawbar out further are you changing the tone color of the fundamental or building a new chord? or both? or not quite either?

Ted's synth patches here are similarly concerned with longer scale understandings of the frequency spectrum: both kinds of longer range averages of timbre but also pulling out features in ways that can also signify as notes. The performances then were a collective effort to tease out a constantly shifting timbre that was also a kind of generative field of harmony in a more old-fashioned musical sense. I found ways of playing that would reliably trigger or sometimes reliably confuse the ways that Ted's electronics were listening. I think we both understood the resulting sound as a single entity rather than a duet.

We chose two contrasting takes for this cassette, and did some minimal mixing and editing but largely left the original performances in tact. The conceptual link to the more sci-fi end of 70s/80s ambient is deliberate:)"
