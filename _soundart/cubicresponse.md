Cubic response uses acoustic feedback and acoustic resonance to create autonomous sounding objects that produce sounds that are a combination of those produced by the other objects, the ambient sounds of the space, and the resonance of the individual object.

The installation consists of seven circuits which record, manipulate and play sounds heard from other parts of the installation.  This process creates a unique sonic ecosystem in which each agent reacts to the space differently. A viewer / listener is free to move around the space. The installation is interactive in that sounds produced in the space will have a direct and immediate impact on the individual sound producing agents as they adapt in response to the new sound.
