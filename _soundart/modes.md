Michael Chion's three listening modes are evoked with a causal speaker, a set of semantic speakers, and a reduced listening speaker. The causal speaker takes the shape of a birdhouse, the semantic speakers are arranged as if to send a message between them, and the reduced listening speaker does not display the speaker cone element.
