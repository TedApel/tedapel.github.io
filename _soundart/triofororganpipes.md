Trio for organ pipes is a sound installation that produces an sonically evolving set of tones from three organ pipes. Each pipe has a celphone inside that picks up the sound from outside the pipe, compresses the dynamic range, and amplifies it through the resonant tube of the pipe. Tones from each pipe are amplified by the others creating a continuing sonic evolution.
