Two small loudspeakers produce the sound of a clothes washer and dryer. A viewer's visual experience of the piece is transformed by the sound of the washer and dryer. The sound creates a space for reinterpretation of the physicality of the speaker boxes as washing and drying machines. The object's initial strong identity as a loudspeaker is put into flux by the sonic signifiers of the piece.
